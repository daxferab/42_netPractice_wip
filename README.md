# Description
The **Net Practice** project focuses on learning how computer networking works.\
Consisting on 10 levels, it presents students with incorrectly configured network diagrams that they must fix.\
The purpose of the project is to introduce the student to concepts such as TCP/IP addressing, routers and switches or gateways.
# Instructions
Once the tar file attached to the project's page has been downloaded and extracted, you have to run the `index.html` file.\
This file will prompt an interface in which you can choose between practice and evaluation mode. You should enter your intra login in order for the configuration files to be correct.\
The interface will show clues on why the configuration is not working on the bottom right.\
Once a level has been completed, a configuration file must be exported by clicking `Get my config`. The student has to submit 10 configuration files corresponding to each exercise, which will be placed at the repository root.\
During the evaluation, the student has to fix 3 random network diagrams in 15 minutes or less.
